# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project predicts taxi ride fares in New York City using machine learning regression techniques. The model leverages geospatial and time-based features engineered from pickup and drop-off data.

##  Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** for regression models
- **GeoPy** for calculating geodesic distances
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## Key Features
- ✅ Cleans and preprocesses NYC taxi ride data  
- ✅ Engineers features including distance, hour, weekday, and passenger count  
- ✅ Visualizes trip zones and fare vs. distance/time trends  
- ✅ Trains and compares multiple regression models:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- ✅ Evaluates models using MAE and RMSE metrics
